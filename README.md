# OHtml
A(nother) OCaml HTML building library

## Influence

- [elm-ui](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-ui)
- [Tyxml](https://github.com/ocsigen/tyxml)
- [elm-css](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css)
- [blaze-html](https://github.com/jaspervdj/blaze-html)

## Naming

This is Html in OCaml.

There is a similarly named library [OhtML](https://github.com/tjdevries/OhtML),
as in, Oatmeal. Due to capitalizion (`ohtml` vs `oHtml`) should be no conflicts.
